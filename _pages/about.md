<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

I am an undergraduate at the **Massachusetts Institute of Technology** pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in **Computer Science and Engineering (Course 6-3)**.

I am passionate about developing new cutting-edge tools and techniques for computer scientists. I am also excited to use computational approaches to solve complex problems in other domains. I am especially interested in the intersection of **computer vision**, **computational photography**, and **machine learning**. 

I have spent over 12 years doing robotics, including competing in FIRST Robotics. In addition to competing, I have volunteered as judge, referee, and tournament director. I continue to mentor middle school robotics teams and run three major educational websites designed to teach others programming and mechanical skills through LEGO robotics.

In my free time, I enjoy helping build the [Desmond](http://desmond.mit.edu/) community on campus and playing soccer. I also enjoy building LEGO robots and many of my designs have been featured by the LEGO Group and at events around the world.

Please contact me by email if you would like a copy of my CV.
