Between 2020 and 2022, I collaborated with my brother, Sanjay Seshan, to design three LEGO robotics models for the newly launched MINDSTORMS product.

In May 2021, the LEGO group added the first of our three LEGO models to the new 51515 MINDSTORMS Robot Inventor Set. Melody Maker was  designed to be a quick build to capture curiosity and inspire young users to explore the basic features of Robot Inventor. The robot drives over the colored bricks to play musical notes. A hidden mode also allows the user to color the color sensor in the model to drive over a strip of paper.

In June 2021, the LEGO Group added our Print and Scan robot to the Community section of the Robot Inventor App. My brother and I had been known for creating a series of printing machines over the years. This particular model was unusual because it used the parts only in one set. This printer could print letters.

In August 2022, the LEGO released  our third model, Color Catcher, was added to the official LEGO MINDSTORMS software. The model featured a newly added multi-robot functionality in the MINDSTORMS software. Color Cather was a fun, fast-paced two-player game that requires two MINDSTOMRS sets to play. Players race to "catch" the randomly picked color that is displayed on the hub. We hope you enjoy playing this game.

To download build instructions and code for any of these models, install the newest MINDSTORMS App and go to the Community section.
