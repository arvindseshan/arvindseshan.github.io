I created an interactive game with real-time hand-tracking and neural network-based gesture identification using ``OpenCV`` and ``TensorFlow`` in ``Python``. The project won 1st place term project.

The name of my project is Magic Axolotl Academy. Check out the [demo video <i class="fa-brands fa-youtube"></i>](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZiF5McRtccM) and the [GitHub repository <i class="fa-brands fa-github"></i>](https://github.com/arvindseshan/Magic-Axolotl-Academy).

It is a spell casting game where a player uses different hand movements to cast various spells (—, &#124;, u, n, ⚡, and ♥) and move the main character. The main character is Kimchee the Axolotl. The main enemies are smog monsters because the biggest threat to axolotls are urbanization and pollution, threatening their environment. Enemies can be defeated by performing the correct order of spells displayed over the enemy when a line of sight is established between the alxolotl and a monster. The idea for the game is based on the 2016 and 2020 Google Doodle called [Magic Cat Academy](https://www.google.com/doodles/halloween-2020).
