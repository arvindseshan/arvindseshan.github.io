For the last seven years, I have been creating and sharing interactive LEGO robotics models. Many of these robots have been featured on LEGO and LEGO Education social media sites, and LEGO events such as LEGOWORLD Copenhagen.

Many of my designs are based on parts from just one kit to ensure that others can build them. Tic-Tac-Toe and Rock-Paper-Scissors are two fun games I created where a human player plays against the LEGO robot.

Right before I left for MIT, I built this Firefly robot as an interactive pet. The Money Reader model was designed to use the machine learning capabilities of the newly released MINDSTORMS set.

Connect 4 allows a player to play against a SPIKE Prime robot. LEGO Education featured this robot in all its social media channels. The SPIKE Prime, which was coded using Python, keeps track of all moves and optimizes its move each round. 

Another SPIKE Prime robot that I created in collaboration with Sanjay featured a SPIKE Prime robot that prints images. Images get converted to a bitmap on a computer. The Python program on the SPIKE Prime reads the bitmap and prints it out. The printhead moves to the appropriate pixel and draws a dot.
